AskToProteins
=============

This academic project is based in downstream language parsers,  the application (implemented in java) lets make queries on chain protein. You can begin your query having the DNA chain, the software automatically translate it to proteins.

Technoligies used: Java
Libraries: Guava (https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/), Antlr (http://www.antlr.org/)

In this repository you will find a theoretical work about downstream language parsers called 'Analizadores descententes'. On the other hand you will notice a folder called PL_TVG, is the src folder of the project (import it to the workbench to see the project and try it).
Write your query in the file called 'consulta.txt' and the input in the file 'entrada.txt'.
The language used in the work is spanish because is an university work for the etsii (https://www.informatica.us.es/)
